          Trips made by New York Cityâ€™s iconic yellow taxis have been recorded and provided to the TLC
          since 2009. Yellow taxis are traditionally hailed by signaling to a driver who is on duty and seeking
          a passenger (street hail), but now they may also be hailed using an e-hail app like Curb or Arro.
          Yellow taxis are the only vehicles permitted to respond to a street hail from a passenger in all five
          boroughs.
